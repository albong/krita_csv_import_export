# krita_csv_import_export
Python plugin for Krita to add back CSV support since this is currently broken and removed from the application as of 4.2.9.

Actually, importing doesn't work since the Krita API doesn't allow access to animations. I think its possible by creating temp files and importing the animations that way?
